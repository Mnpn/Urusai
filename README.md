Stop Bluetooth devices from being set as the audio input source on macOS.

Ever gotten a [Continuity phone call](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT209456) while listening to music on your AirPods, only to have your ears blasted away by beyond loud and low-quality sound because the audio input device keeps defaulting to your headphones every single time they connect? Maybe something similar, or something even worse? It kinda stinks. Urusai stops this from happening by outright not letting you or your Mac select a Bluetooth device as an audio input.

## Installation
It's easiest to download a release from [the releases page](https://github.com/Mnpn/Urusai/releases), but you're more than welcome to clone the repository and build it yourself using [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)!
